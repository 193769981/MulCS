## Experiment Description
To observe the impact of this practice on the dataset, we counted the distribution of lines of code between the data we used (i.e., the compilable data) and the overall data. The experimental results are shown in the following figure.

The horizontal axis represents the number of lines of code, and the vertical axis represents the number of code snippets located on that line.

#### The results show that the distribution of lines of code is generally consistent, with the uncompiled code fragments having no impact on the distribution of the dataset.
